##How to run Project locally?

1. Clone the project
2. write npm install to install all the dependencies.
3. write npm run dev to run the app in development mode.
4. Open the application in the specified port in the terminal.

##About the Project:

1. This project is built using Next.js and Typescript.
2. PWA is incorporated in this application
3. I have used React Suspense for asynchronous operation.
4. Implemented both Server and Client components for optimal performance.

##What' s new that I have implemented:

1. Add Highly rated games section where the games rated above 4.5 are displayed.
2. Add light and dark mode theme switcher at the top-right instead of bottom-right(like in the original website).
3. Users can see all the games in the same page when they click on View more section instead of redirecting them to that page. If the user wants to redirect then they have to click on the navbar links.
4. On Hover the user can see the details about the game in Tooltip section.
5. In the original website when I add a game to favourite and then refresh the page, the icon is not active. Here it is fixed.
